A POC using Golang's net library to display an image given a GET request to localhost:8080

# Running locally
Place an image at /tmp

I used https://unsplash.com/photos/body-of-water-under-sky-6ArTTluciuA and named the file waves.jpg

To run the proof-of-concept with that file, clone this repo,

navigate to the root of the cloned directory,

and run `make run` from a terminal.
